# Hey, I'm Ahmad

**SDE II @ Amazon | Architect of Quiet Power | System Builder with Soul**

I build systems like others write poetry — clean, resilient, and with zero tolerance for bloat. 
Currently at Amazon, refining how machines help people search, decide, and scale. 
Previously at Expedia, Delivery Hero, ESLFaceIT — wherever systems needed vision and edge.

"Great code reflects the soul of the person behind it."

### :thought_balloon: What I Believe

Complexity isn’t intelligence. Clarity is. 
Systems should be felt, not just executed. 

Style > noise. Purpose > position.
